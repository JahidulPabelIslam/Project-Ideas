# Project Ideas

During Final (Third) Year of my Degree (2017) I was tasked to design and develop an improved Web Application for the management of Project Ideas for an MSc Degree.

> The School of Computing's MSc <a href=http://www.sums.port.ac.uk/spi/ target="_blank" title="Link to Orginal Project Ideas Application">project ideas database</a> is currently implemented in a non-MVC style. It also has limited searching functionality. It does not permit people who submit ideas to be able to edit them or withdraw them.
> The requirement is to implement better searching and user editing of ideas. Only the owner of an idea (the person who created it) or a designated administrator can edit or withdraw an idea.

All users can view ideas submitted, can search ideas, users can log in and can sign up if they are an outside organisation, logged in users can submit an idea, a submitter or staff can edit and delete an idea.

A member of staff can create a new user (staff, student or organisation), approve or unapprove an organisation and delete a user, change the status of an idea.

All users can change their details and staff can change any users details.

A student user can select an idea to complete as their project, or staff or an organisation can select a student who will complete their idea as their project.

Built Using Java EE 7, JSF 2, Bootstrap3.
